          Greetings! I'm Vah, an Armenian expatriate  and currently residing in the vibrant landscapes of Cambodia,
          nestled in Southeast Asia. My journey has taken me across borders and
          cultures, spanning from China to Russia, and eventually leading me to
          the enchanting town of Kampot. Since 2018, I've been passionately
          imparting knowledge in the realms of English and Math, channeling my
          expertise across diverse international settings. As I guided eager
          minds through the intricacies of these subjects, I found myself drawn
          to the captivating world of web development.

        <p className='text-xl'>
          In late 2021, I embarked on a new odyssey, delving into the intricate
          realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With each passing day, I've
          diligently nurtured these skills, witnessing their evolution from
          nascent concepts to formidable tools in my arsenal. This continuous
          refinement has now reached a point where I stand poised to embrace the
          role of a junior web developer. The intersection of creativity and
          logic in web development resonates deeply with me, and I'm thrilled to
          embark on this exciting chapter. If you're seeking a dedicated and
          eager learner with an unwavering commitment to growth, I would be
          truly honored to engage in a conversation with you. Thank you for your
          invaluable time and consideration. Warm regards, Vah
